# pekko-connectors-google-cloud-pub-sub-grpc

A variant of the Apache Pekko connector of the same name but that uses the latest Pekko gRPC 1.1 snapshot so that it can also update the Google pubsub lib to the latest version.

The Apache Pekko version is constrained by trying to maintain compatibility with Pekko gRPC 1.0.x.
